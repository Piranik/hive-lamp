The inspiration of this project came from [DC Legends of Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_Tomorrow) S01: E15  
I saw this amazing artifact and I said to myself that I must build one, exactly like that

In this project I used ESP32 connected to 5 meter of WS2182b LED strip (300 LEDS).

I will replace the LED string to RGBW so I can set it to clean white like in the picture (the firmware will be updated).

TODO:  
- [ ] Change RGB string to RGBW
- [ ] Create PCB 
- [ ] Complete mobile app (see mobile_app branch)
